# LESSONS.md

## Intent
- Preserve lesson history so corrections are traceable and promotable into durable rules.

## Usage rules
- Append only; do not rewrite historical entries except to fix factual errors.
- Add one entry per learning event.
- Keep entries concise, evidence-based, and linked to rule promotion status.
- Use home-relative paths (`~/...`) when referencing files.

## Entry template
Copy this block for each new lesson:

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD - <short title>
- Trigger: <user correction / escaped defect / failed check / review finding>
- Context: <scope and impacted area>
- Lesson: <trigger-condition -> required-action>
- Evidence: <error, failing check, review link, or repro note>
- Promotion target: <WORKFLOW.md / INTEGRATION.md / CODING.md / DELIVERY.md / DOCUMENTATION.md / new-topic>
- Disposition: <promoted / pending>
- Follow-up: <none or explicit next action>
```
